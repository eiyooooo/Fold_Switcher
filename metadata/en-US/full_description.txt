This application can switch between various folding states on foldable devices, such as closed mode, half-open mode, tent mode, and fully open mode. Some devices support dual-screen display.

Most devices can switch modes in user mode (out-of-the-box), while a few devices require Shizuku mode for switching.

Getting Started Guide:
1. Install the app
2. If prompted for Shizuku permissions, please download Shizuku and follow the Shizuku manual for configuration instructions.
3. Click on the fold state to switch.

If you are unable to switch fold state normally, please try switching to a different execute mode.

Quick Switch Settings:
1. Long press on the fold state to set it as Quick Switch.
2. For Android 13 and above, a request will appear. For other Android versions, you need manually pull down the status bar and edit the switch.

You can also control the fold state from automation apps like Tasker, MacroDroid, or through ADB commands. See GitHub repository for detailed instructions.
